The first half of the third advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo observing run obtained data for 39 gravitational wave events, of which 36 are analysed within this report. The main sources of gravitational waves are from CBC events. These can involve collisions of black hole binary systems (BBH), neutron star binary systems (BNS) and black hole â€“ neutron star systems (NSBH). The chirp mass and total mass parameters have been analysed to find the mass value at which total mass proves dominant with respect to the precision. This value was found in this paper to be approximately 50Msun, however more analysis is required due to ambiguous correlations between the total mass and the ratio of total mass to the 90% credible interval range. Justification of a less-points approach to acquisition of chirp mass posterior samples from observational data has also been investigated using bootstrapping. The results of this look promising and could be used to justify a 40% reduction in the number of posterior samples currently obtained for the chirp mass of GW events, and looks to be justifiable for both low-mass and high-mass systems.
